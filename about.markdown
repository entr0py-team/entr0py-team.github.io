# Origins

The origins of the entr0py team started in NYC 2017. "The Company" hired 4 engineers to build out the Identity Management and Authentication services for the platform. The team's name? You guessed it. Over time, each engineer left the company, but continued to bounce ideas off of each other and stay in touch.

In the Defcon 27 OpenCTF competition, the team reunited for their first CTF, where they managed to rank 39 out of 200 competing teams! Since then, the team has been steadily improving and practicing, gearing up for the Defcon 28 OpenCTF.
